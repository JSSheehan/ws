I am a data scientist with five years of professional experience in data science with a passion for baseball analytics. I graduated in 2016 from Johns Hopkins University with a Bachelors of Science in Applied Mathematics and Statistics. While pursuing my degree I headed the data and business operations for the baseball training program Impact Baseball Baltimore and worked for the Johns Hopkins Baseball team and Cal Ripken Summer League. After graduating I have worked on improving my data science skills at Booz Allen Hamilton where I work for the Aerospace account to address their most pressing and challenging data needs. These projects include creating predictive models, visualizing data through dashboards, and analyzing survey results to draw key insights. 

While not at work I spend most of my time pooring through baseball statistics and watching baseball games. On this site I include side projects where I seek to use and improve my data science skills and apply them to baseball.
